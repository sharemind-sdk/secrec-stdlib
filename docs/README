If you want to create documentation, where "Related Pages" is called "Language reference".

1.
download the latest SOURCE from
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html

2.
extract files and go to the folder
../doxygen-x.x.x/src
open the file "translator_en.h"

3.
find the line that says:

{ return "Related pages"; }

change it to:

{ return "Language reference"; }

save and close the file

4.
open your terminal at the
doxygen-x.x.x directory
run the configure script:

"sh ./configure"

* if doxygen throws errors, install whatever packages it needs(dot,perl,flex,bison) via the package manager.
next compile doxygen:

"make"

and finally install doxygen:

"make install"

5.
The last thing that needs to be done, is to make sure the files "build_html.sh" and "Doxyfile" are in the same folder and that
that the PROJECT_NUMBER on line 41 of "Doxyfile" is correct. Then, run:

"./build_html.sh"

the folder "html" should appear in your current directory.
